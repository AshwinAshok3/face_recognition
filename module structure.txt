Your system will do 4 distinct things:

Face Detection
→ Find faces in images / video frames

Face Alignment
→ Normalize face (eyes, nose, pose)

Face Embedding (Feature Extraction)
→ Convert face → 512-D vector

Face Identification (1:N Matching)
→ Compare embedding against a database of known people

This is NOT object detection, NOT tracking, NOT re-ID.
This is face recognition. Period.
